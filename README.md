# Time Series Analysis on Household Energy Consumption

This repository contains an analysis for Time Series Analysis using the [UCI Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) dataset.

## Objective

Analyze and forecast household energy consumption using a complete Time Series Analysis pipeline. This includes data cleaning, decomposition, stationarity testing, model building, and evaluation.

## Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Time Series Decomposition  
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test  
- ACF & PACF Analysis  
- ARIMA Forecasting  
- Performance Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)

## Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `statsmodels`  
- `scikit-learn`

## Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
- File used: `household_power_consumption.txt`
